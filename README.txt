# PIG-E (Prediction Interfacial Geometric Energy)

PIG-E is a python module to calculate the elastic strain energy component of an interface between a matrix and precipitate in a material using a dislocation-based approach. 
The user inputs the necessary materials parameters (example notebook and data included with the code) and the code calculates the interfacial energy. 

v1.0 Sept 2025

Full code documentation is in ARL-TR-10169. Additional information about the materials parameters can be found in ARL-TR-10028
